Hi,

I'm the maintainer of Vale, a linter for prose that allows users to implement custom quality-assurance checks (spell check, repeated words, capitalization, etc.) for their documentation.

One of the challenges of implementing Vale (especially with Markdown content) is getting it to correctly handle what I call "non-standard" markup: templating, shortcodes, snippets, and so on. To make this easier, I'm in the process of creating reusable configurations (or, "packages") for common static site generators and template engines, and I chose this repo as a test case for the Liquid package.

Findings
The following are a few of the errors I found while testing the package. I aired on the side of caution while going through the results; I ignored cases like "collectd" / "Collectd" (casing inconsistencies) and "filesize" / "file size" (spacing inconsistencies), among others.

You can find the full list of cases that I ignored below.

Configuration
If you'd like to add Vale to this repo, here's the configuration I used:

StylesPath = .github/styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion

# The accept.txt file is given above
Vocab = Base

SkippedScopes = script, style, pre, figure, alt, strong

[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale

TokenIgnores = ({%.+?%}), ({{.+?}})

BlockIgnores = (?s) *({% raw %}\n.*?\n{% endraw %})
This generally worked pretty good. There were still a few edge cases that I needed to disabled Vale on (using <!-- vale off --> comments), such as the tables in migrating-from-circleci-to-github-actions.md.

I understand if this isn't something you're interested in, but I figured I'd share my work just in case.

@jdkato Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts in here. We have been trying to implement Vale on this repo since quite some time. We faced a few blockers owing to the challenges while handling non standard markup situations. We raised raised this and this issue in the past with the challenges we had.

With your suggestion, I am currently using TokenIgnores to ignore liquids during linting. The use of regex in BlockedIgnores is something I haven't tried so I am going to check out your configuration.

Thanks so much for choosing the GitHub docs repo as a test for your use case. I will get back to you once I test this and discuss with the team 💖 .

Thanks @jdkato, this is so great! You're right that Liquid in our Markdown has posed some challenges for us in setting up Vale.

I tried out your config and the results are really promising. The main scenario I wasn't able to get it working on is nested Liquid. So for example, in this block:

1. Under "Management", type the username of the person you want to designate as a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} manager in the organization, and click **Grant**. 

    ![Add a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} manager](/assets/images/help/organizations/add-github-app-manager.png)
☝️ Vale correctly ignores the first data tag but incorrectly flags the term prodname in the second tag. I am assuming this is because the second tag is nested in image markup, although I am not 100% sure that's the reason.

One workaround we've had success with is simply stripping out the Liquid tags via a regex (a la perl -p -e 's/{%.*?%}//g' content/*) before running Vale. We realize this hack only works because our Liquid tags never span more than one line; if our replacement changed line breaks, the Vale action's PR commenting would be inaccurate. But the simplicity of this approach has an appeal.

Curious what you think about the nested tag scenario and the best approach for that.

The configuration I shared above should handle this case by adding alt to SkippedScopes. It's not ideal because you miss out on linting alt tags but, at the same time, the prevalence of templating in them means the content isn't all that meaningful from a linting perspective anyway.
